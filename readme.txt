Implementation of a fancy TestNG reporter (IReporter) which visualizes test dependencies as a diagram (Dot / Graphviz). See this thread: http://groups.google.com/group/testng-dev/browse_thread/thread/48429064a526e809

Work in progress !

TODO
  * add graphviz running and configure executable
  * add configuration (report.properties on classpath?)
  * various detail levels (e.g. only test methods depended-upon/depending, all methods etc.)
